# Collections

Every year, around new year, I feel really lonely when all my friends share and comment their spotify activities. <br>
This app attempts to produce comparabable statistics for any discogs user's collection.<br>
It is right now not possible to know the date a release has been added to a collection. <br>
As a consequence, statistics are over the whole collection, and not only over what have been bought/added within the year. <br>

## Work in progress

We are working on a Django website that is not yet ready for a demo.<br> 
We hope deploying it soon on server with a database in the cloud.
